#### PORTFOLIO: DATA ANALYST
#### ABOUT ME
##### Hello, My name is Igor Tyo, I'm a begining data analyst. I have more than 13 years of experience in banks in business lending. Now I am studying in SKYPRO and taking Google Analytic course.In this repository you can find some of my projects completed during training and practice. 
#### SKILLS AND TECHLOGIES
##### Data analysys tools: SQL, Excell <br>Programmimg Languages and Libraries: Python, Pandas, Math<br> Database Managment Systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL <br> Data Vizualization tools: PowerBi, Matplotlib, Seaborn < Machine Learning Tools <br> Machine Learning Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
#### PROJECTS
##### Project 1: Unit Economics Calculator
##### Task 1.  Add the "Attraction Adjustment Coefficient" indicator to the parameters list of our calculator<br>Task 2. Set the default value of this indicator to 100% and allow the ability to change this indicator for the calculation period 05.21-04.22 through the "Change" column, similar to others<br>Task 3. Configure the dynamic calculation of the number of new students for the period 05.21-04.22 with adjustment based on this coefficient. If it is 120% for 05.21-04.22, then the calculated value of the number of new students for each month of this period should be 20% higher<br>Task 4. Calculate a scenario in which marketing plans will be increased by 12% (settings for other indicators remain unchanged)<br>
##### Description of solution: The following indicators were calculated: Retention, LT(Lifetime), LTR(Lifetime Revenue), CAC(Customer Acquisition Coast), CAC per unit, Share of CAC and Cost, and Margnitality.

##### Result: A new hiring plan has been developed with the number of new teachers per month for the period from 05.2021 to 04.2022
##### Project 2: Joining Tables in SQL
##### Task 1.  Calculate the proportion of those who directed films in 2018 and continued to direct in 2019<br>Task 2. Calculate banking reserves for late and early recovery<br>Task 3. Compare the average prices of private rooms available for a minimum of 30 days in three cities
##### Description of solution:The following operations were used to solve the tasks: left join, right join, count, float, group by, union operator, and union all.
##### Link to the Project: 
##### Result: The proportion of those who directed films in 2018 and continued to direct in 2019 has been calculated. For example, if there were 10 individuals directing films in 2018, and 3 of them continued their work in 2019, the proportion of transition from 2018 to 2019 would be 30%<br>Data on loans issued in Moscow has been obtained<br>Average prices for private rooms, which are rented for a minimum of 30 days, have been obtained for three cities (New York, Dallas, Oakland)
