#### PROJECTS
##### Project 1: Unit Economics Calculator
##### Task 1.  Add the "Attraction Adjustment Coefficient" indicator to the parameters list of our calculator
##### Task 2. Set the default value of this indicator to 100% and allow the ability to change this indicator for the calculation period 05.21-04.22 through the "Change" column, similar to others
##### Task 3. Configure the dynamic calculation of the number of new students for the period 05.21-04.22 with adjustment based on this coefficient. If it is 120% for 05.21-04.22, then the calculated value of the number of new students for each month of this period should be 20% higher
##### Task 4.  Calculate a scenario in which marketing plans will be increased by 12% (settings for other indicators remain unchanged)
